# Second Milestone

## What was the original goal of your project?

My orignal goal was to create an app with different buttons that had predetermined messages and on click would paste that messages into the text box on imessage, so all the user would have to do is click send.

## How have the goals of your project changed?

Originally I was planning on having 3 buttons that all had their own predetermined message. But, since then my objectives have changed and at this point in my project I have one button which leads to a text and one that leads to a tutorial page for cooking. (add more about end goal)

## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

The most significant thing I've learned how to do while building my app is how to use the Imessage extension on Xcode. The Imessage extension allows an app to be displayed in imessage(much like how gamePigeon is). More specifically I learned how to input text into the text bar in your Messages through the app. This allows for the app to display predetermined texts and all the user has to do is click send.

## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

A challenge I faced while making the app was that I initially tried to pass messages from another view controller into the main on in order to display the message in the text bar. This didn't work because for some reason once you enter another view controller the Imessage extension will no longer prompt a message like before. To get around this I had to make my whole app on one view controller, which was very challenging. 

## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

If I were to do the project again I would have created all my buttons programmatically instead of through the story board. When I initially started making the app I thought I could use multiple different view controllers, hence having the buttons on the story board wouldn't be an issue. But, as I progressed I realized that I would have to use one view controller, and having all my buttons on one view controller got very cluttered. Creating all my buttons programmatically would have made the story board much neater and would have prevented a lot of the problems I encountered.
