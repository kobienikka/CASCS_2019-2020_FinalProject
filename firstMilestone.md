What is the current goal of your project?
  - have the first three buttons segue to another viewController where there will be more options pertaining to which of the      first three buttons you clicked. I then want depending on what information was selected in the second viewcontroller to be    passed back into the first view and then show up as a prompted text.  
 
 What have you accomplished so far toward that goal?
  - I have finished one button on the first view to segue to the next and give further options on what food you would like to   select.
  
What do we need to know if we want to run your project in its current state? For example, maybe this app can only be run on your phone, not in Simulator. Or maybe there are a couple of bugs that the user needs to avoid for now.
  - My app is a Imessage app (same type of app as game pigeon) so you need to attempt to text someone to use the app. It also   may work better on your phone instead of a simulator. And, when you open the app you should slide up to make it full screen   as the buttons wont be formatting correctly otherwise. 
  
What percentage of your goal would you estimate you have completed? Measure this in time spent working on the project so far and the amount of time you estimate you would need in order to complete the project. So if, for example, you've worked 10 hours on this project and you think it would take 15 more hours to complete it, then you are 40% of the way done.
  - I've spent around 7 hours on the app so far and I think it will take another 7. So I'm 50% done. 

What is the most significant achievement you've made so far on this project? This could be something you built (a feature of the app) or the way that you built it (the way your code is written).
  - getting my buttons to display a predetermined text and image in the text box on imessage. 

What do you anticipate being the hardest part of the remainder of your project?
  - getting the data to segue back from the second view controller to the first viewcontroller
